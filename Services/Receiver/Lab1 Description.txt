Description:
This is an application that receives records the flow of players playing in different zone and assigns players to different zones in a game.
The events are two types of zones, Zone 1 for higher rank players and Zone 2 for the rest. For Zone 1, we expect to have maximum flow of 100000 queue requests per second, while Zone 2 expects maximum flow of 500000 queue requests per second.
The quests are stored to allow the following:
* Administrators to view numbers of each Zone to determine the maximum flow of each zone
* Analysis of time at peak hour during days of a week
* Recorded data across different zone players to avoid crowd traffic
Users of the system are administrators (who controls the game server), shareholders (who makes decision of what to change for the game) and players (who plays the game).
